# CheckMyWeather
A simple Android Application implementing HTTP request and Parsing weather Data.
I have used a simple HTTP Request library to fetch weather data from Openmyweather API and Parsed its retrieved data
using JsonObjects.

Also I have tried to add intent for searching any cities to add as a functionality.

It also has two gradient background themes to be switched between. Essentially providing the trending Night Mode
but not in the truest sense.
